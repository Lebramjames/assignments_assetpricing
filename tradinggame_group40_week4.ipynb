    "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a hypothesis put forth by Harry Markowitz in his paper \"Portfolio Selection,\" (published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance) is an investment theory based on the idea that risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment.\n",

    "**ALPHA:** Alpha is used for mutual funds and all types of investments. It is often represented as a single number (like 3 or -5), but this refers to a percentage measuring how the portfolio or fund performed compared to the benchmark index (i.e. 3% better or 5% worse). Alpha is often used in conjunction with the beta, which measures volatility or risk. Alpha is also often referred to as “excess return” or “abnormal rate of return.”\n"
